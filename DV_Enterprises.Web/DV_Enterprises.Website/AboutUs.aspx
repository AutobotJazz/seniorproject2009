<h2 class="title">About Us</h2>
<p>Smart Greenhouse Solutions is an offshoot of DVEnterprise.  
Smart Greenhouse Solutions was established in early 2009 with a vision for a smarter, greener, self-sustaining greenhouse. 
The company headquarters are located in Orlando, Florida. As a new company, Smart Greenhouse Solutions took on a number of ideas ranging from 
individual control modules for greenhouses to the design of an entire greenhouse structure.   
Though we are starting off with a couple of modular products which will enhance a pre-existing greenhouse, our vision is to create and market 
a complete smart greenhouse containing the most up-to-date technologies.  The complete end product will be able to aid in an abundance of crop yields, 
lower one’s energy bill and be an all around more efficient greenhouse.

Smart Greenhouse Solutions specializes in automated control systems with remote monitoring capabilities.  Our modules will be sold individually or as a 
complete system. We are dedicated to providing powerful, reliable, and affordable control solutions to our customers.  We stand behind the quality of our 
products and maintain excellent sales service and customer support.

<p>
All greenhouse control companies and their systems are NOT created equal. Smart Greenhouse Solutions rises above the competition by combining its control 
system with a web monitoring interface and simulation game system. Smart Greenhouse Solutions is committed to the environment and we ensure that our products 
leave the smallest carbon footprint possible.  Our goal is to develop the leading smart greenhouse on the market, specializing in energy saving modular systems!
