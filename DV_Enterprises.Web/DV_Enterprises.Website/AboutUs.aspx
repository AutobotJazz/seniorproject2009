<h2 class="title">About Us</h2>
<p>Smart Greenhouse Solutions is an offshoot of DVEnterprise.  
Smart Greenhouse Solutions was established in early 2009 with a vision for a smarter, greener, self-sustaining greenhouse. 
The company headquarters are located in Orlando, Florida. As a new company, Smart Greenhouse Solutions took on a number of ideas ranging from 
individual control modules for greenhouses to the design of an entire greenhouse structure.   
Though we are starting off with a couple of modular products which will enhance a pre-existing greenhouse, our vision is to create and market 
a complete smart greenhouse containing the most up-to-date technologies.  The complete end product will be able to aid in an abundance of crop yields, 
lower one’s energy bill and be an all around more efficient greenhouse.
</p>
<p>
Smart Greenhouse Solutions specializes in automated control systems with remote monitoring capabilities.  Our modules will be sold individually or as a 
complete system. We are dedicated to providing powerful, reliable, and affordable control solutions to our customers.  We stand behind the quality of our 
products and maintain excellent sales service and customer support.
</p>
<p>
All greenhouse control companies and their systems are NOT created equal. Smart Greenhouse Solutions rises above the competition by combining its control 
system with a web monitoring interface and simulation game system. Smart Greenhouse Solutions is committed to the environment and we ensure that our products 
leave the smallest carbon footprint possible.  Our goal is to develop the leading smart greenhouse on the market, specializing in energy saving modular systems!

<h2 class="title">Our Stance on the Environment</h2>
<p>
At Smart Greenhouse Solutions, we are aware that greenhouses can ultimately demonstrate energy self-sufficiency even within the 
challenge of environmental and economic changes.  One of the best ways to ensure a bright future on our planet is to support the work 
and designs of communities intending to <span style="color:#009900">"go green"</span> around the world. At Smart Greenhouse Solutions we are taking a leap forward by 
helping farmers reduce the amount of energy used in greenhouse operations.   People who are committed to saving energy are encouraged 
to add Smart Greenhouse Solutions products to their lifestyle. 
</p>
<p>
Our products offer up to 30% in energy savings which is truly beneficial both financially and environmentally.   At Smart Greenhouse Solutions
 we have created a new paradigm in business that is “part of the solution” of restoring balance for our natural world. The company vision also 
 grew out of the values we hold dear. The innovation of our own company’s product came directly out of the desire to maximize greenhouse production 
 and to lessen environmental damage.
</p>
<p>
We know that the beauty and efficiency of growing in greenhouses creates a natural learning opportunity for children of all ages. On our property, our greenhouses are a living laboratory where children and adults are welcome to come tour, learn about new greenhouse technology and becoming “part of the solution”.  At Smart Greenhouse Solutions the miracle of life is celebrated from seed to fruit.
