            <h4 class="title">What is the Smart Greenhouse Solutions’ Liability should the control system fail?</h4>
               <li>Liability of course depends on what may have caused the system to fail.</li>
               <li>Hardware failure and software failure resulting from proper use will result in replacement of the product, or should the customer choose a full refund will be given.</li>
                <li>If, however, the requirements are ignored and the system fails because of the user’s inability to follow the instructions given to care for the system then the customer becomes liable for the system failure.</li>

        <ul id="faq14" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">What are some of your available sensors and uses?</h4>
                <li>For our initial system the DS1620 Temperature sensor is one of the sensors that is used by the system. It is used to monitor the temperature currently inside the greenhouse, which the microcontroller needs to trigger the cooling device.</li>
                <li>The second sensor used is the Light to frequency sensor, which takes the light level present in the room and converts it to a frequency that is then manipulated to control the light level in the room.</li>

        <ul id="faq15" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions handle indoor/outdoor relationships?</h4>
                <li>In cases like temperature the Smart Greenhouse Solution Module can detect the temperature from both inside and outside the greenhouse and through that can decide whether or not the opening or closing of the vent could assist in the cooling/heating of the greenhouse.</li>

          </ul>
     
        
        <ul id="faq16" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">How are climate zones handled?</h4>
                <li>The control system is designed to coordinate the activities of all equipment that is used to produce and modify a climate zone.</li>

        <ul id="faq17" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions control light?</h4>
                <li>Information from light sensors is incorporated in light based decision programs.</li>
                <li>Lighting is set to the ideal light level required for the particular crops that are being grown.</li>
             <a class=" back_to_top"href="#questions">back to questions</a>
           </ul> 
 
        
        <ul id="faq18" class="faq clearfix">
           <h4 class="title">How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions control temperature?</h4>
                <li>Using the temperature sensor readings the Smart Greenhouse Solutions system can trigger cooling or heating devices to control and regulate the temperature within the greenhouse.</li>
                <li>The system stores the ideal temperature for growing particular crops and as a result keeps the temperature within a set threshold ideal for the system.</li>

         </ul>
   
        
        <ul id="faq19" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">What happens if the PC fails?</h4>
                <li>The microcontroller built into the hardware is responsible for monitoring and controlling the environmental settings and as a result if the PC fails the system should still be running perfectly.</li>
             <a class=" back_to_top"href="#questions">back to questions</a>
         </ul>
    
        
        <ul id"faq20" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">What happens in a power failure?</h4>
                <li>In a power failure the system will continue to monitor the temperature and light levels in the room as the system will also have a battery backup that is capable of keeping the system running.</li>
                <li>High voltage devices such as an air condition unit or the high voltage lamps may not be capable of running through a battery and as a result an additional method of powering these devices such as a generator is required as well.</li>
                <li>The software will be stored in non-volatile memory and as a result the loss of power will not result in the loss of information.</li>
             <a class=" back_to_top"href="#questions">back to questions</a>
         </ul>   
       
        
        <ul id="faq21" class="faq clearfix">
            <h4 class="title">What backup systems are recommended?</h4>
                <li>A generator capable of powering the cooling device is definitely recommended as should the power go out the system will still be able to completely control the environment regardless.</li>
