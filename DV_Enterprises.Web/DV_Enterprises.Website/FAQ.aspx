<p>
<strong>What should I consider when looking to purchase an environmental control system?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the environmental changes that you want to be monitored are offered on the system.</li>

<li>Customer Support is a definite plus when selecting the system</li>
<li>Service guarantees are also something to consider when making your final decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What level of computer competency is required for the system?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Little or no computer skill is required to operate the system, the system is termed “smart” for the reason that after it is turned on it performs the monitoring and temperature regulation by itself for the environmental setting you choose</li>
<li>As for installation the ability to follow instruction is the only requirement as the system has been manufactured to require as little technical knowledge as possible during installation</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Will I save money by investing in a Smart Greenhouse Solutions System?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing a Green Smart Solution system will save you not only money but time as well. Ideal growing environments will lead to better quality crops and reduce the risk of the destruction of crops due to poor environmental settings.</li>
<li>The efficiency of the Smart Greenhouse Solutions modules also leads to reduced energy costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What does a system cost?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The price will vary depending on the number of features (modules) that you wish to add to your system, all prices are listed on the website.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Can I install the system myself?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Included in every system package will be an installation manual outlining the step-by-step method of installing the system.</li>
<li>Should you have any problems understanding the installation manual our Help Desk will be available to walk you through the installation.</li>
<li>For an additional fee a trained technician can install the system for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How often will I need to upgrade my system hardware?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The hardware provided will be sufficient to maintain your system for as long as you need it. Additional parts that may wear down over time such as relays, but can be replaced easily.</li> 
<li>The system can be upgraded to fit the user’s specific preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions handle software upgrades?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Should any “necessary” software upgrades become available such as fixes for discovered bugs then they will be provided free of charge.</li>
<li>If there is a major software version update adding new features and functions you have the option to purchase the upgrades at a discounted rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What happens when I need to expand my control system?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>All our systems are upgradeable – as we create and add new features to our system and make them available to you, should you choose to upgrade and add more functions to your control system a slight software modification might become necessary which will be of no additional cost to you.</li>
<li>The control system will expand as much as you want it to.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Do you provide wireless and mobile access?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>No, mobile and wireless access is the responsibility of the customer.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What is the Smart Greenhouse Solutions’ Liability should the control system fail?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Liability of course depends on what may have caused the system to fail.</li>
<li>Hardware failure and software failure resulting from proper use will result in replacement of the product, or should the customer choose a full refund will be given.</li>
<li>If, however, the requirements are ignored and the system fails because of the user’s inability to follow the instructions given to care for the system then the customer becomes liable for the system failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What are some of your available sensors and uses?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>For our initial system the DS1620 Temperature sensor is one of the sensors that is used by the system. It is used to monitor the temperature currently inside the greenhouse, which the microcontroller needs to trigger the cooling device.</li>
<li>The second sensor used is the Light to frequency sensor, which takes the light level present in the room and converts it to a frequency that is then manipulated to control the light level in the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions handle indoor/outdoor relationships?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In cases like temperature the Smart Greenhouse Solution Module can detect the temperature from both inside and outside the greenhouse and through that can decide whether or not the opening or closing of the vent could assist in the cooling/heating of the greenhouse.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How are climate zones handled?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The control system is designed to coordinate the activities of all equipment that is used to produce and modify a climate zone.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions control light?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Information from light sensors is incorporated in light based decision programs.</li>
<li>Lighting is set to the ideal light level required for the particular crops that are being grown.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>How does Smart Greenhouse Solutions control temperature?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the temperature sensor readings the Smart Greenhouse Solutions system can trigger cooling or heating devices to control and regulate the temperature within the greenhouse.</li>
<li>The system stores the ideal temperature for growing particular crops and as a result keeps the temperature within a set threshold ideal for the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What happens if the PC fails?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The microcontroller built into the hardware is responsible for monitoring and controlling the environmental settings and as a result if the PC fails the system should still be running perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What happens in a power failure?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In a power failure the system will continue to monitor the temperature and light levels in the room as the system will also have a battery backup that is capable of keeping the system running.</li>
<li>High voltage devices such as an air condition unit or the high voltage lamps may not be capable of running through a battery and as a result an additional method of powering these devices such as a generator is required as well.</li>
<li>The software will be stored in non-volatile memory and as a result the loss of power will not result in the loss of information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What backup systems are recommended?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>A generator capable of powering the cooling device is definitely recommended as should the power go out the system will still be able to completely control the environment regardless.</li>
</ul>
